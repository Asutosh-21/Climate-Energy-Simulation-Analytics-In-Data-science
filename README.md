# üåç Global Climate & Energy Simulation Analytics

**Domain:** Energy ‚Ä¢ Sustainability ‚Ä¢ Environment  

This project forecasts energy demand, models pollution impact, and simulates renewable vs. non-renewable adoption scenarios.  
It demonstrates **end-to-end data science, machine learning, and simulation skills** that are valuable in consulting, energy, and climate-tech roles.



## üìå Purpose & Problem Statement
**Problem:**  
Governments, utilities, and sustainability teams need to understand:
* How future energy demand will grow.
* How different renewable-adoption strategies affect emissions.
* The uncertainty in those predictions.

**Solution:**  
This project provides:
1. **Time-series forecasting** of energy demand and emissions.
2. **Scenario simulation** (Monte Carlo) to quantify uncertainty.
3. **Interactive visualization** so stakeholders can explore ‚Äúwhat-if‚Äù outcomes.

## üîë How It Works ‚Äì Step by Step

1. **Data Ingestion & Cleaning**  
   * Load multi-year climate and energy datasets.  
   * Handle missing values, resample to monthly/annual frequency.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**  
   * Visualize energy mix, pollution levels, and seasonal patterns.

3. **Time-Series Forecasting**  
   * **Prophet**: quick baseline forecasts with seasonality & uncertainty bands.  
   * **LSTM**: deep learning model for long-term, non-linear dependencies.

4. **Monte Carlo Simulation**  
   * Define probability distributions for demand growth & renewable adoption.  
   * Run thousands of simulations to estimate a range of future outcomes.

5. **Visualization & Dashboard**  
   * Plotly charts to compare actual vs. predicted values and scenario distributions.  
   * Optional Dash app for interactive ‚Äúwhat-if‚Äù exploration.
